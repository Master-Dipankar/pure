PROPRIETARY LICENSE — VISUAL & BRAND ASSETS
=============================================
LICENSE VERSION 2.0 — Effective Date: February 14, 2026

Copyright (c) 2025-present Dipankar Boruah. All rights reserved.

This license ("License") governs all files, materials, and content contained
within this repository ("Repository"), including any files added to it at any
point in the future, without the need for amendment or update to this License.

By accessing, viewing, downloading, forking, cloning, or otherwise interacting
with this Repository or any of its contents, you expressly acknowledge that you
have read, understood, and agree to be bound by all terms of this License. If
you have forked, cloned, or downloaded any content from this Repository before
reading this License, you must either comply with all terms herein or delete
all obtained copies within forty-eight (48) hours of first viewing this License.


1. DEFINITIONS
--------------

"Brand Assets" means every file in this Repository, at any point in time, past,
present, or future, including but not limited to: logos, icons, images,
illustrations, graphics, animations, videos, audio marks, design mockups,
typography specimens, color palettes, style guides, and any other visual or
multimedia material, in any file format (including but not limited to PNG, SVG,
JPG, JPEG, WEBP, GIF, MP4, MOV, PDF, AI, PSD, FIGMA, and any format not yet
invented), regardless of the directory or sub-directory in which they reside.

For avoidance of doubt, this License file itself and any plain-text README or
CONTRIBUTING documentation files that contain no embedded media (including but
not limited to base64-encoded images, inline SVG code, or embedded binary data)
are excluded from the definition of Brand Assets. For files containing both
excluded and included content (such as HTML files with inline SVGs, markdown
files with embedded images, or documents with embedded media), this License
applies to all Brand Asset portions therein, regardless of the file format or
container.

"Copyright Holder" means Dipankar Boruah.

"Authorized Contributor" means any person who has received express, documented,
written permission from the Copyright Holder to add materials to this
Repository. Acceptance of a pull request or merge does not, by itself,
establish a person as an Authorized Contributor for any purpose beyond that
specific contribution.

"Associated Products" means the products, applications, services, and brands
currently or in the future created, owned, operated, or licensed by the
Copyright Holder — whether directly or through affiliates, licensees, or
authorized partners — including but not limited to: AudiFlo, PureMusic, ZrotA,
Zrota Group, and any successor, variant, derivative, or future product names,
services, or brands.

"Bona Fide Editorial Use" means use by journalists or media outlets that
maintain a verifiable publication history of at least one (1) year, for the
purpose of factual news reporting, product reviews, or critical analysis. This
includes established news organizations, credentialed press members, and
independent journalists with a demonstrable body of published work. It does not
include commercial aggregation sites, image galleries, asset libraries,
clickbait content, social media re-posts, or any use whose primary purpose is to
display or redistribute Brand Assets rather than to provide original editorial
commentary.

"Written Authorization" means a formal document or email issued by the Copyright
Holder from the designated contact address listed in §19 that explicitly
identifies: (i) the specific Brand Asset(s) being licensed — either by
individual file name/path or by clearly defined category (e.g., "all icons in
the /social/ directory"); (ii) the permitted scope, purpose, and duration of
use; and (iii) a reference to this License. Written Authorization includes
traditional signed documents and electronic signatures compliant with applicable
e-signature laws, but excludes informal communications such as casual emails,
text messages, chat messages, social media posts, or verbal statements.


2. COPYRIGHT DECLARATION
------------------------

The Copyright Holder is the original author and sole owner of all Brand Assets
in this Repository. These works are original creative works protected under:

  (a) The Copyright Act, 1957 (India), as amended;
  (b) The Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works,
      providing automatic copyright protection in all 180+ member nations; and
  (c) All other applicable international intellectual property treaties,
      including the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the TRIPS Agreement.

Copyright subsists automatically upon creation of each work. No registration,
notice, or formality is required for copyright to attach, though this License
serves as an express declaration of rights.

The Copyright Holder also asserts all moral rights in the Brand Assets as
provided under Section 57 of the Copyright Act, 1957 (India) and equivalent
provisions under the laws of other jurisdictions, including but not limited to
the right of attribution (paternity) and the right against distortion,
mutilation, or other modification prejudicial to the Copyright Holder's honor
or reputation. These moral rights are perpetual, inalienable, and survive any
assignment or transfer of economic rights. Violations of moral rights are
subject to the enforcement provisions of §7.

NOTE: This License protects the visual artistic expression embodied in the Brand
Assets — the specific designs, illustrations, color arrangements, and graphical
compositions. Copyright protection applies to the artwork itself, independent of
any product names or word marks depicted therein.


3. AUTOMATIC COVERAGE & CONTRIBUTOR ASSIGNMENT
-----------------------------------------------

Any file, asset, or material added to this Repository at any time — whether by
the Copyright Holder or any Authorized Contributor — is automatically and
immediately covered by this License without requiring any amendment, update, or
re-publication of this License. The act of adding a file to this Repository
constitutes a declaration that the file is a Brand Asset and is subject to all
terms herein.

Any person who submits, uploads, or otherwise adds any material to this
Repository (including via pull request, merge, or direct commit) thereby
irrevocably assigns all copyright, title, and interest in such material to the
Copyright Holder. By making such contribution, the contributor acknowledges and
agrees that:

  (a) They retain no rights to the contributed material;
  (b) The material becomes the sole property of the Copyright Holder upon
      submission;
  (c) The opportunity to participate in and be publicly credited as a
      contributor to the Repository constitutes adequate and sufficient
      consideration for this assignment;
  (d) Acceptance of a contribution does not grant the contributor any license
      to use the Brand Assets beyond what is stated in this License;
  (e) The contributor represents and warrants that they are the original
      creator of, or have full legal authority to assign, all contributed
      materials, and that such materials do not infringe upon the intellectual
      property rights of any third party;
  (f) The contributor agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Copyright
      Holder against any and all claims, damages, or expenses arising from
      any breach of the warranty in subsection (e);
  (g) The contributor represents that they are at least eighteen (18) years
      of age or the age of majority in their jurisdiction, whichever is
      greater. Contributions from minors are not accepted. If a minor
      nevertheless contributes, no assignment shall take effect, and the
      contributed material shall be removed promptly upon discovery; and
  (h) The assignment in subsection (b) is conditional upon the warranty in
      subsection (e) being true and accurate. If the warranty is breached,
      no assignment shall be deemed to have occurred, and the contributed
      material shall be removed immediately upon discovery of the breach.

      License, whether or not such manner is specifically enumerated above.


5. LIMITED EDITORIAL LICENSE
----------------------------

Journalists and media outlets engaged in Bona Fide Editorial Use (as defined in
§1) are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable,
revocable license to use Brand Assets solely for news reporting, product
reviews, commentary, and criticism related to the Associated Products, subject
to ALL of the following conditions:

  (a) The Brand Asset must be used in its original, unaltered form — no
      modification, cropping (except proportional scaling), recoloring,
      distortion, or overlaying is permitted;
  (b) Clear and prominent attribution must be provided, stating:
      "Logo/Image © Dipankar Boruah. Used for editorial purposes.";
  (c) The use must not imply endorsement, sponsorship, or partnership with
      the Copyright Holder;
  (d) Use shall be limited to a maximum of three (3) Brand Assets per article,
      review, or editorial piece, unless additional use is essential to the
      editorial context and approved in Written Authorization by the Copyright
      Holder;
  (e) Screenshots or screen captures of Brand Assets are permitted solely
      within the scope of this editorial license and subject to all conditions
      herein; and
  (f) This editorial license may be revoked by the Copyright Holder at any
      time by sending written notice to the editorial contact address publicly
      listed by the media outlet (or, if none, to any publicly available

      delivery of the notice. "Confirmed delivery" means any of the following:
      (i) email with read receipt confirmation; (ii) email with manual reply
      acknowledgment; (iii) registered or certified mail with proof of
      delivery or tracking confirmation; or (iv) personal service with
      signature.

This editorial license does not extend to commercial use, advertising,
merchandising, or promotional materials of any kind.


6. NO IMPLIED LICENSE
---------------------

Nothing in this Repository — including its public visibility on GitHub or any
hosting platform, the ability to view, fork, clone, or download the Repository,
or any action by the Copyright Holder in sharing or referencing the Repository —
shall be construed as granting any license, right, or permission to use the
Brand Assets beyond what is expressly stated in this License.

GitHub's Terms of Service may permit forking and cloning of public repositories
for the purposes of contributing back to the original repository. Such
permissions do NOT extend to any use of the Brand Assets outside the direct
context of contributing to THIS Repository. If a fork is created for the purpose
of contributing and the contribution is rejected, the contributor must delete the
fork within forty-eight (48) hours of rejection. For purposes of this section,
"rejected" means a contribution that has been (i) explicitly closed, declined,
or marked with a negative disposition by the Copyright Holder or an authorized
maintainer; or (ii) left without any substantive action for sixty (60)
consecutive days after submission. The contributor shall not be liable for
residual caches or Git history artifacts that cannot be deleted due to platform
limitations beyond the contributor's control.

Temporary, automatic browser caches or CDN caches created during normal viewing
of this Repository are permitted as incidental technical reproductions for
viewing purposes only. This does not grant any right to extract, redistribute,
or use cached content beyond ephemeral viewing.

Brand Assets remain subject to this License regardless of the platform, mirror,
archive, or hosting service from which they are accessed or obtained. Ignorance
of this License, or failure to observe it on a mirror or third-party site, does
not constitute a defense against infringement.


7. ENFORCEMENT & REMEDIES
-------------------------

The Copyright Holder reserves all rights to enforce this License to the fullest
extent permitted by law, including but not limited to:

  (a) Issuing cease-and-desist notices and DMCA takedown requests;
  (b) Seeking temporary, preliminary, and permanent injunctive relief;
  (c) Claiming actual damages, statutory damages, and/or disgorgement of
      profits;
  (d) Recovering reasonable attorney's fees, legal costs, and expenses;
  (e) Pursuing criminal prosecution where applicable under the Copyright Act,
      1957 (India) or equivalent laws in other jurisdictions; and
  (f) Recovering costs and fees arising from any frivolous legal challenge
      brought against this License or the Copyright Holder's rights thereunder.

An infringer's lack of knowledge or intent shall not constitute a defense
against enforcement.

The Copyright Holder may, at sole discretion, provide written notice and a
period of fourteen (14) calendar days to cure unintentional or good-faith
breaches of this License before pursuing full legal remedies. This discretionary
cure period does not create any obligation on the Copyright Holder to provide
such notice, and the absence of such notice does not affect the Copyright
Holder's right to immediate enforcement at any time.


8. INDEMNIFICATION
------------------

Any person or entity that uses Brand Assets in violation of this License agrees
to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Copyright Holder from and against
all claims, damages, losses, costs, and expenses (including legal fees) arising
from or related to such unauthorized use.


9. SEVERABILITY
---------------

If any provision of this License is held to be invalid, illegal, or
unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall be
modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable, or if
modification is not possible, shall be severed. The remaining provisions shall
continue in full force and effect.


10. NO WAIVER
-------------

The failure of the Copyright Holder to enforce any provision of this License at
any time, or to exercise any right or remedy herein, shall not constitute a
waiver of such provision, right, or remedy, nor shall it prevent the Copyright
Holder from enforcing that or any other provision at any future time. No waiver
shall be effective unless made in writing and signed by the Copyright Holder.


11. GOVERNING LAW & JURISDICTION
---------------------------------

This License shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of
India. Any disputes arising under or in connection with this License shall be
subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in the city where
the Copyright Holder maintains their principal place of residence or business
in India.

For infringements occurring outside India, the Copyright Holder reserves the
right to elect to pursue claims and seek enforcement under the applicable laws
of the jurisdiction where the infringement occurs, consistent with the Berne
Convention and other applicable international treaties.


12. TERM & SURVIVAL
--------------------

This License is effective as of the date of the first commit to this Repository
and shall remain in effect for the full duration of copyright protection as
provided by applicable law (including any extensions thereof).

This License survives deletion, archival, transfer, or removal of the
Repository. All copies of Brand Assets previously obtained, downloaded, forked,
or cached remain permanently bound by the terms of the License version in effect
at the time each copy was obtained (see §20 for version governance).


13. ASSIGNMENT & SUCCESSORS
---------------------------

This License and all rights granted herein are personal to the Copyright Holder
and may be assigned, transferred, or sublicensed by the Copyright Holder to any
successor, heir, legal representative, or entity (including any company or
organization formed by the Copyright Holder) without notice or consent. Such
assignment shall not diminish or alter the protections of this License. No other
party may assign any rights or obligations under this License.

In the event of the Copyright Holder's death, legal incapacity, or bankruptcy,
all rights under this License shall transfer automatically to the Copyright
Holder's legal heirs, designated estate representatives, or appointed trustees,
and all protections herein shall remain in full force and effect.


14. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES
-----------------------------

The Brand Assets are provided on an "AS IS" basis. The Copyright Holder makes no
representations or warranties of any kind, express or implied, regarding the
Brand Assets, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability,
fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of third-party rights.
The Copyright Holder shall not be liable for any claims arising from authorized
use of the Brand Assets by a permitted user.


15. ACCESSIBILITY
-----------------

Notwithstanding the restrictions in §4, the use of Brand Assets by assistive
technologies — including screen readers, text-to-speech engines, magnification
tools, AI-powered accessibility assistants, and other accessibility aids — for
individuals with disabilities is permitted solely for personal accessibility
purposes. This exception extends to institutional accommodations provided by
libraries, educational institutions, and accessibility service providers solely
for the benefit of individuals with disabilities. For avoidance of doubt, this
exception permits the use of AI-powered assistive technologies for personal
accessibility, but does not authorize the use of Brand Assets to train
general-purpose AI models or for any purpose beyond the individual's personal
accessibility needs. This exception does not authorize storage, redistribution,
or any commercial use.


16. STATUTORY RIGHTS
--------------------

Nothing in this License is intended to, nor shall be construed to, limit or
diminish any rights provided by applicable statutory exceptions, including fair
use (as recognized under applicable law), fair dealing (as recognized under
Indian Copyright Act, 1957 §52 or equivalent international provisions), or other
copyright limitations and exceptions mandated by law. To the extent any
provision of this License conflicts with a mandatory statutory right, the
statutory right shall prevail, but only to the minimum extent required by law,
and all other provisions of this License shall remain in full force and effect.


17. LEGAL COMPULSION
--------------------

Disclosure or production of Brand Assets required by a valid court order,
subpoena, government mandate, or other legal compulsion does not constitute a
violation of this License, provided that the disclosing party: (a) promptly
notifies the Copyright Holder of such requirement (unless prohibited by law from
doing so); (b) makes reasonable efforts to request confidential treatment of the
disclosed Brand Assets; and (c) limits disclosure to the minimum extent required
by the legal obligation. Such compelled disclosure shall not give rise to any
damages, penalties, or enforcement remedies under §7.


18. ENTIRE AGREEMENT & ACCEPTANCE
----------------------------------

By accessing, viewing, downloading, forking, cloning, or otherwise interacting
with this Repository or any of its contents, you expressly agree to all terms
of this License.

This License constitutes the entire agreement between the Copyright Holder and
any user of this Repository regarding the Brand Assets and supersedes all prior
or contemporaneous communications, representations, or agreements, whether
written or oral. No amendment, modification, or waiver of any term shall be
effective unless made in writing by the Copyright Holder.

Permission to use Brand Assets is valid only when issued as a Written
Authorization (as defined in §1). All permissions granted under Written
Authorization are non-transferable and non-sublicensable unless explicitly
stated otherwise in the Written Authorization itself.

Recipients of Written Authorizations should verify authenticity by confirming
through a secondary communication channel if there is any doubt about the origin
of the authorization.


19. CONTACT FOR PERMISSIONS
----------------------------

All inquiries regarding permissions, licensing, or authorized use of Brand
Assets should be directed to the Copyright Holder:

  Dipankar Boruah
  Email: dipankar@zrota.us

No permission is granted unless issued as a Written Authorization from the above
contact address that satisfies the requirements of §1 and §18.


20. AMENDMENTS & VERSIONING
-----------------------------

The Copyright Holder reserves the right to modify, update, or replace this
License at any time. The most current version of this License shall always be
the version present in the Repository and shall supersede all prior versions.

Each download, fork, clone, or other acquisition of Brand Assets is governed by
the License version in effect at the time of that acquisition. Updated License
terms apply only to: (i) Brand Assets obtained after the effective date of the
updated License; and (ii) any new access, download, fork, or clone of the
Repository made after the update. Continued interaction with the Repository
after a License update constitutes acceptance of the updated terms for all
subsequent interactions.

Use of automated systems (including CI/CD pipelines, bots, scrapers, or similar
tools) to access this Repository constitutes acceptance of the current License
terms by the person or entity operating such systems. System operators are
responsible for ensuring awareness of and compliance with the current License
terms.

Users are solely responsible for reviewing the current License terms before any
use of Brand Assets. The Copyright Holder will make reasonable efforts to note
material amendments in the Repository (such as updating the version number and
effective date in this License header), but absence of notice does not affect
the validity of amendments.
